 ## Description 
 Shell Programming minishell1 Epitech Teck1
 
 You have to program a UNIX command interpreter.  
The interpreter is expected to display a prompt ( $> , for example) and then wait for you to write a command
line, which must be validated by a newline.

The prompt must be displayed again only after the command execution.  
Only basic command lines are expected to executed; no pipes, redirections or any other advanced features.  
The executables should be those found in the path, as indicated in the PATH variable.

If the executable cannot be found, you must display an error message and display the prompt again.  
Errors must be dealt with and must display the appropriate message on the error output.
